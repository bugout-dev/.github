# How to contribute to Moonstream

We welcome productive contributions to Moonstream. We also realize that it can be difficult to make productive contributions to open source projects as an outsider,
with no context about the project. For this reason, if you are not familiar with Moonstream, we urge you to join us on [Moonstream Discord](https://discord.gg/4kxbz5BqNz).
Message anyone on the `#moonstream` team, and we will help you get started.

If you prefer reading documentation, you can also use [the Moonstream documentation site](https://docs.moonstream.to) as an entrypoint to the project.
